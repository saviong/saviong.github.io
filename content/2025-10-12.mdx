I passed Terraform Associate exam on 5 Oct 2025!

[![HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (003)](https://github.com/saviong/saviong.github.io/blob/main/public/hashicorp-certified-terraform-associate-003.png?raw=true](https://www.credly.com/badges/4d07a91e-a75c-4353-bfe3-05b5ba491058/public_url)

When I studied the tutorials and learned from the documentation, this helps me to manage the multi-cloud services and deploy the automation scripting to manage the cloud.
