  summary:
    `My love for technology started long before I ever had a formal job. Growing up in Hong Kong, I was the kid who enjoyed creating simple web games in PHP and CGI just for fun. Building things, solving puzzles, and experimenting with ideas has always been part of who I am.

I originally studied Chemistry at university in Hong Kong, but everything changed during an exchange semester at TUM in Germany. That experience wasn’t only about academics. I discovered new perspectives through the culture, the food, and even the beer. Traveling and meeting people from different backgrounds opened my mind and shaped how I approach challenges today.

When I entered the professional world, I naturally looked for ways to improve processes. I started automating tasks with VBA and later built workflows in Power Automate that saved my team hours of repetitive work. That was my turning point. I realized my passion was in using technology to simplify life and make things more efficient. Since then, I have focused on Cloud and DevOps, moving away from the lab bench and into building scalable infrastructure with tools like Terraform and Bicep.

Outside of tech, I enjoy bringing ideas to life with my 3D printer, whether it is a useful gadget or a custom design. Music is also a big part of my life. I play piano, keyboard, and guitar, which helps me relax and express creativity in a different way. I also enjoy hiking and camping, something that grew from weekends outdoors in Hong Kong. On quieter days, I like gaming on my Xbox, Switch, or even revisiting some retro classics. Cooking is another way I unwind and explore creativity.`,
