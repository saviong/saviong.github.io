# My GitHub Page

Welcome to my digital playground! This repository holds the code for my personal website, which started its life as a fork of the fantastic [dillionverma/portfolio](https://github.com/dillionverma/portfolio) and has grown into something uniquely my own.

This portfolio is built on the Next.js framework and styled with Tailwind CSS. Three.js and Framer Motion are used to create dynamic 3D visuals and animations. The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages, ensuring the live version always reflects my latest work.
